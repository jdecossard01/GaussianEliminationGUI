 Gaussian Elimination GUI Project

This project implements the Gaussian Elimination method in C++ to solve systems of linear equations. It includes row pivoting, testing of solutions, and a GUI component (optional) designed for Windows systems.

## Features
- **Gaussian Elimination Method**: Solves linear systems with row pivoting for numerical stability.
- **Solution Verification**: Automatically verifies the computed solutions.
- **User Input**: Supports user-defined augmented matrices.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Core functionality works on all platforms; GUI requires Windows.

## How to Compile and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/_jdecossard01/REPO_jdecossard01.git
